This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to null and undefined values. The `bug.js` file shows a function with a potential error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the use of loose equality (==) which can lead to unexpected type coercion and incorrect results when comparing null or undefined values with numbers.  The solution uses strict equality (===) to explicitly check for null or undefined values, preventing these unintended type conversions and ensuring correct output.
